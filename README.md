## Problem Statement

Drug discovery is a highly time-consuming and resource-intensive process. 
Existing computational tools for molecular generation and optimization often suffer from limited diversity, slow exploration, and poor usability for researchers. Despite recent advances in AI-driven molecular generation, there remains a gap between research models and practical, researcher-friendly systems capable of rapidly proposing novel, chemically valid drug candidates.

## Detailed Description

- Traditional drug discovery pipelines require years of experimentation and extensive trial-and-error, leading to high costs and delayed treatments.

- Existing AI-based molecular generators such as VAE and early GAN models often struggle with mode collapse, limited novelty, or unstable training.

- Many recent transformer-based approaches demonstrate promising results in academic settings but lack validation, reproducibility, or integration into usable research workflows.
