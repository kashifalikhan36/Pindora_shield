## Problem Statement

Drug discovery is a highly time-consuming and resource-intensive process. 
Existing computational tools for molecular generation and optimization often suffer from limited diversity, slow exploration, and poor usability for researchers. Despite recent advances in AI-driven molecular generation, there remains a gap between research models and practical, researcher-friendly systems capable of rapidly proposing novel, chemically valid drug candidates.

## Detailed Description

- Traditional drug discovery pipelines require years of experimentation and extensive trial-and-error, leading to high costs and delayed treatments.

- Existing AI-based molecular generators such as VAE and early GAN models often struggle with mode collapse, limited novelty, or unstable training.

- Many recent transformer-based approaches demonstrate promising results in academic settings but lack validation, reproducibility, or integration into usable research workflows.
([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.12796v1))

- Researchers struggle to generate diverse, optimized, chemically valid molecules quickly, as models often produce invalid structures, fail synthesizability checks, or overlook multi-property optimization in practical drug pipelines.

## Overview :
The proposed system operates in four major stages:

1 -> Disease & Target Identification
2 -> Molecular Retrieval & Analysis
3 -> De Novo Molecule Generation
4 -> Comparative Evaluation & Optimization

Each stage is designed to reduce manual intervention while ensuring chemical validity, diversity, and optimization across multiple drug-relevant properties.

## Work FLow 
Pindora Shield follows a structured pipeline where disease-specific molecular candidates are generated and evaluated across multiple drug-relevant dimensions.

Step 1: Disease Context & Target Identification
The system accepts disease-related inputs and identifies relevant target proteins using curated biomedical knowledge sources.
This establishes biological relevance before molecular analysis begins.

Step 2: Molecular Processing (SMILES Representation)
Known molecules linked to identified targets are retrieved and represented using standardized SMILES strings, providing a consistent molecular format for downstream analysis.

Step 3: De Novo Molecule Generation (TangGen)
![TenGAN Overview](tengan_overview.png)
Based on the disease and target context, a generative model (TangGen) is used to generate alternative candidate molecules.
- Generates diverse and novel SMILES strings
- Ensures chemical validity and structural diversity
- Explores chemical space beyond known drugs

This step produces a large pool of candidate molecular SMILES.

Step 4: Multi-Model Molecular Evaluation
Each generated SMILES is evaluated individually using five specialized, trained models:
- IC50 prediction (potency)
- pChEMBL value (bioactivity)
- Target association score
- Clinical phase likelihood
- Target relevance (exploratory)
Rather than using a single multi-task model, each property is predicted by an independent, optimized model, improving accuracy and interpretability.
   - In effect, every SMILES generated by TangGen is passed one-by-one through all five models, producing a comprehensive property profile.

Step 5: Filtering & Shortlisting
Predicted outputs are combined to filter low-potential candidates and shortlist molecules based on pharmacological relevance and feasibility.

Step 6: Comparative Analysis & Ranking
Shortlisted candidates are compared with existing medicines, and a ranked comparative analysis is produced to support research-level decision making.
